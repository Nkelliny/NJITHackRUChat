This is a chat app that is also intergrated with inbox's phone api.  The idea is that a user can participate in a chat either from the web or by phone with chat updates being pushed back to the phone from the web app.  Phone users can also enter commands such as "/video youtube.com/fakeVideo" which would display a video for anyone using the chat app or "/search example" which would use Bing's search api to return a result to both the phone and the users on the webchat.
